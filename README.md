# fgcg (Finn's Gantt Chart Generator)

This is a [Gantt Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) generator similar to those found in most cloud-based project management systems.

## Why make another one?
* Because it's a great "Portfolio" project
* To prove that my back-end design works (a former co-worker of mine insisted that it wouldn't)
* To practice developing with React (which is used for the front-end)
* To practice developing in COBOL (which I plan to use for an alternative back-end; The main back-end is written in [Go](https://go.dev))
